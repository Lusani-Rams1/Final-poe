## Overview

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (6.0 or later)
- A modern web browser for the HTML files
- Optional: an editor with Live Server (e.g., VS Code) for serving static HTML

### Build and run (C#)
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository root (or the folder that contains the .csproj/.sln files).
2. Build the project:

   dotnet build

3. Run the project (if it's a console or web app):

   dotnet run --project <path-to-project.csproj>

 <path-to-project.csproj> with the path to the C# project file if necessary.

### Run the front-end (HTML)
- If the HTML files are static, open the main HTML file (for example, index.html) in your browser.
- To serve the files locally with live reload, use an editor extension (Live Server) or a simple static server like:

  npx http-server ./ -o
